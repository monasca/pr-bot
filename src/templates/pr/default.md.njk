{#
some additional parsing is done on the output of PR templates, since titles are
technically a separate field:
  - the first non-empty line is used as the PR title
  - the first non-empty line after the title line begins the body

variables exposed:
  - commit: the parsed commit message as generated from the commit template
            exposes fields: `title`, `body`, `raw`
  - up: the settled Update instance
